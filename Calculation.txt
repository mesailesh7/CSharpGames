 The Goal: Calculate SubTotal and Tax


  The main goal of these two lines is to calculate the total price of all items in an order (SubTotal) and then
  calculate the sales tax on that subtotal (Tax).


  Both lines do almost the same calculation, so let's focus on the SubTotal line first.

  Breaking Down the SubTotal Calculation


  Here's the line of code:


   1 SubTotal = o.OrderDetails.Sum(od => od.UnitPrice * od.Quantity * (1 - (decimal)od.Discount)),



  Let's dissect it from the inside out.

   1. `o.OrderDetails`: This refers to the list of all individual items included in the current order (o). Think
      of it as a list of rows on a receipt, where each row is one product.


   2. `.Sum(...)`: This is a LINQ method that calculates the sum of a numeric property for every item in a list.
      In this case, it's going to add up the final price of each OrderDetail to get the SubTotal.


   3. `od => ...`: This is a lambda expression. It's a short way of writing a function that will be executed for
      each item in the OrderDetails list. The od is a variable that represents a single order detail (one item in
      the order) as the .Sum() method loops through them.


   4. `od.UnitPrice * od.Quantity`: This is the standard way to calculate the total price for a single item before
      any discounts. For example, if UnitPrice is $10 and the Quantity is 2, the result is $20.


   5. `(1 - (decimal)od.Discount)`: This part calculates the discount.
       * od.Discount is a number representing the discount percentage. For example, a 10% discount would be
         represented as 0.10.
       * The error you saw was because Discount was a float (a less precise decimal type) and UnitPrice was a
         decimal (a more precise type used for money). C# doesn't let you multiply these two different types
         together directly.
       * (decimal)od.Discount is a cast. It tells the compiler, "Treat this float value as a decimal for this
         calculation." This solves the error.
       * 1 - (decimal)od.Discount gives you the percentage of the price the customer actually has to pay. For a
         10% discount (0.10), this would be 1 - 0.10 = 0.90. So, the customer pays 90% of the original price.

   6. Putting it all together: For each order detail (od), the code calculates:
      UnitPrice * Quantity * (PercentageToPay)


      The .Sum() method then adds up these results for all items in the order to get the final SubTotal.

  The Tax Calculation

  Now, let's look at the Tax line:



   1 Tax = o.OrderDetails.Sum(od => od.UnitPrice * od.Quantity * (1 - (decimal)od.Discount)) * 0.05m


  This line is almost identical to the SubTotal calculation.


   1. It first calculates the exact same SubTotal value again by summing up the final price of all items after
      discounts.
   2. Then, it multiplies that total by `0.05m`.
       * 0.05 represents a 5% tax rate.
       * The m at the end of 0.05m tells the C# compiler that this number is a decimal type, which is important
         for financial calculations to avoid small rounding errors.

  So, the Tax is simply the SubTotal multiplied by 5%.

  Summary for a Beginner


   * SubTotal: We go through each item in the order, calculate its price after discount, and then add all those
     prices together.
   * Tax: We take that final SubTotal and multiply it by the tax rate (5% in this case) to find out how much tax
     is owed.
   * The Fix: The key change was adding (decimal) to ensure that all the numbers in our calculation were of the
     same high-precision type, which is what C# requires for these kinds of operations.
